# Terms of Use of the Publishing Tools

(dated 16/2/16)

The term publishing tools is understood to mean (dated 16/02/16):

- UiTdatabase API
- Calendar Widgets: hosted by publiq calendar module
- Culture Feed Module Suite, a set of Drupal-based calendar modules

The Calendar Widgets and the Culturefeed Modules are built on top of the UiTdatabase API.

## I. Unconditional acceptance of these terms of use

publiq offers you the ability to access UiTatabank data in a simple way through the use of the UiTdatabank API. The UiTdatabank API, referred to as the API below, is available via the URL at http://documentatie.uitdatabank.be. All the technical documentation is also there.

The use of the API, the database "UiTatabank" and the data from the UiTabank is permitted only if you, without any reservation, agree to all of the following conditions and correctly observe and apply them.

publiq reserves the right to extend or modify these Terms of Use at any time. The most current version is always available via http://documentatie.uitdatabank.be. We therefore advise you to regularly consult these terms of use and check for changes.

The term "user" means 'the physical person, entity or corporation that uses the API and through this API accesses the  "UiTdatabase" and the data from this database. The conditions of these terms of use apply regardless of whether the user directly uses the publishing tools or, for example, outsources to an IT supplier or software developer.

## II. Regarding the use of theUiTdatabase publishing tools

### Service conditions
A user can submit a project to use one of the publication tools.

### Environments and access
There is direct and free access for the test environment.

At the request of the user, publiq can switch the project to the production environment. This involves an annual administrative cost of  €80 excl VAT. publiq expects a link to the project/app that uses the API, to provide free feedback and tips with regard to optimal use of the API.

publiq also provides generic developer keys that provide access to the production environment. These are for temporary use to work out a proof of concept, change at irregular times and do not give any right to a continuously available service.

The API key ("access key") assigned to the user is for personal use only and may not be transferred or communicated to a third party.

### Support

All technical documentation for use of the publishing tools can be found at http://documentatie.uitdatabank.be

Regarding the use of the API, we do not provide free technical support within the above context.

Ad hoc support is available as a professional service, and is charged in man-hours, with a minimum of 3 hours. Please contact with vragen@uitdatabank.be.

For Culture Feed Drupal Modules the same service conditions apply as for the use of the API.

For the widgets, in addition to the administrative cost of the access key, there is also a cost for the hosting ( €30 excluding VAT / year).

### Permissible use

The use of the publishing tools is not permitted in a manner that causes damage to publiq or to develop products or services that directly or indirectly undermine the business model of the UiTdatabase, namely to collect and enrich leisure activities as completely as possible and to make them available in a growing and thriving ecosystem with the final social objective of broadening participation and participation: "more people, more enthusiasm, more culture".

The use of the publication tools is only permitted for non-commercial purposes. The use of the publishing tools for other purposes is not permitted unless the user obtains the explicit prior written agreement of publiq. The user may not resell the use of the publication tools or the data made available through the publication tools for reimbursement to third parties. Users of the publishing tools must recognise the share alike principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike).

The user may not use publishing tools in a manner or for a purpose that is not in accordance with the law, in the broadest sense of the word. These comprise, without being an exhaustive list, the applicable rules of international, national, regional, local law or custom. So you should,among other things, respect the rules on intellectual property rights, privacy protection and the protection of databases.

The use of the publishing tools is only permitted with explicit mention of the source (eg Source: UiTinVlaanderen.be).In addition, the set requirements regarding the inclusion of logos that publiq communicates to the user for publication on the channel of the user must be respected. The logos and information are available at https://docs.google.com/a/cultuurnet.be/document/d/1dpoow3xwaAlhUtzmSz5rNtoDUWnwybuCbfvfQHwiRFA/edit?usp=sharing

Any adjustments and additions to the data, including enrichments and corrections, must flow back to the UiTdatabase. publiq must be able to distribute these adjustments to other users.

When using the open source Culturefeed Modules, publiq reserves the right to request and use the source code that the user has developed for their own purposes and to make it available to third parties.

The user undertakes not to store or use information obtained via the publishing tools that is privacy-sensitive in the context of the applications that are being built or offered


### Useage Limit

The number of API calls per project, regardless of the chosen publication tool, is limited to 60,000 per day. If a user has exceeded this number, the right of use is immediately denied to them for the rest of the day in question. In the event of repeatedly exceeding of the maximum number of calls, publiq reserves the right to deprive the user of his right of use by rendering his personal key unusable. If the user needs more calls, he can make prior agreements with publiq.

### Availability of API
publiq reserves the right to change the API at any time or to suspend or terminate its availability, without the user being able to claim any right to use the API or any right to compensation for the unavalibility of the API. publiq always tries to communicate about changes via tools.uitdatabank.be. The current use of the API does not create an acquired right to the further use of the API in the future. publiq reserves the right at all times to introduce the requirement that the right of use is made conditional upon the signing of a prior written agreement.

### Malfunctioning of the API
publiq declines any responsibility for the malfunctioning of the API and is therefore not obliged to compensate for any damage that the user suffers as a result of the malfunctioning of the API

### Personal Information
In order to use the API, the user must provide the following data: name of the user, contact information, publication channel or application that will be linked to the API by the user. These data are only used by publiq in function of the use of the publishing tools and to inform the user about this. The user always has the right to access and update his data.

### Indemnity
By using the API, the user undertakes to indemnify publiq wholly and unconditionally for any disadvantage and any damage that publiq suffers as a result of his unlawful or unauthorized use of the API. The user also undertakes to intervene at his personal costs at the first request of publiq in any pending proceedings initiated by third parties on the grounds of his unauthorized use or of damage caused to third parties due to unauthorized use of the API.

### Logging
Each call from the API is stored in a central register and can subsequently be used for analysis and reporting purposes. For free use, publiq can request the web server logs manually or automatically from the server that is used by the user for publication so that these logs can be linked to the API logs. publiq can ask the user to forward a cookie to the visitor of his site to conduct research on returning users. In that case, publiq rejects any liability in case of damage to the user as a result of the refusal of a cookie.

## III. Regarding the use of the UiTdatabase
The user undertakes to respect and correctly comply with the provisions of the Act of 31 August 1998 on the transposition into Belgian law of the European Directive of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases. publiq reserves the right to have any infringement of the aforementioned law punished by civil proceedings or by filing a criminal complaint

## IV. Regarding the delivery of data to the UiTdatabase
The API allows audiovisual material to be supplied to the database. The user should be aware that this audiovisual material is publicly disseminated through the database. The user must therefore respect all applicable copyright and portrait rights, as well as any other applicable law, and may also be held liable.

## V. Regarding the use of data from the UiTdatabase
publiq strives to make the data of the UiTdatabase as accurate and complete as possible. publiq can not be held liable for incomplete or incorrect information, nor for any damage that may result from making available or using the data from the UiTdatabase.

The data from the UiTdatabase are protected under the provisions of the Act of August 31, 1998 on the legal protection of databases, the Law of June 30, 1994 on the protection of computer programs, the Act of June 30, 1994 on copyright and related rights, and any other applicable intellectual property

## VI. General Provisions

### Applicable law
Belgian law applies to the interpretation and implementation of these terms of use. In case of dispute, only the courts and tribunals of the Brussels district have jurisdiction to hear the dispute.

### Divisibility of clauses
The illegality or nullity of one provision of these terms and conditions of use shall not in any way entail the unlawfulness or nullity of the other provisions in these terms of use or of these terms and conditions of use in their entirety. publiq reserves the right, where appropriate, to replace the illegal or void provision with a workable and valid provision.
