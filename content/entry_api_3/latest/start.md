# Introduction Entry API v3

Welcome to the UiTdatabank Entry API documentation!

This is the place to be if you want to import your events in UiTdatabank, so they are automatically published on [UiT in Vlaanderen](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be) and many [other agenda's](https://www.publiq.be/nl/publicatiekanalen).

With the UiTdatabank JSON-LD REST API's it is super easy to setup a sync between your database and UiTdatabank, using simple HTTP requests to create, update or delete content.

If this is the first time you use our API's, it's recommended you head over to [Who can import data in UiTdatabank]({% link content/entry_api_3/latest/who.md %}) and [UiTdatabank Basics]({% link content/entry_api_3/latest/basics.md %}).

When you start a new project, you will have to follow the predefined [flow from test to production]({% link content/entry_api_3/latest/flow.md %}).

You can also skip the intro and go straight to the [API documentation books]({% link content/entry_api_3/latest/api-documentation.md %}).

If you're stuck on anything, contact our [Helpdesk](mailto:vragen@uitdatabank.be). You can also ask the helpdesk to join the Slack developer channel #udb-json-api.
