# API documentation

UiTdatabank provides 2 APIs that can be used for specific cases and are interchangeable. Meaning you can create an offer with the JSON-LD CRUD API and update a specific property of this offer with the JSON-LD API.

## JSON-LD API

With the JSON-LD API you can mimick the entry form on uitdatabank.be to create and update an offer. With this api it is also possible to update specific properties from existing offers, like adding a french translation for the `description` of an event or adding a label to a place.

**Specifics**
* Create an offer with only the mandatory properties (what, where, when...)
* Incrementally update specific properties of an offer
* Publish your event by updating the workflowstatus from "draft" to "ready for validation"

**Steps necessary to create and publish an offer via JSON-LD API**
* Step 1: Create event (`POST /events/`)
* Step 2: Update event (`PUT /events/{eventid}/contactPoint`, `PUT /events/{eventid}/description`...)
* Step 3: Publish event (`PATCH /events/{eventid}`)

**Documentation**

## JSON-LD CRUD API

With the JSON-LD CRUD API you can create a JSON-LD document for an entire offer and send it as a whole to UiTdatabank, instead of sending updates for every property.

Offers created via the JSON-LD CRUD API are instantly published with workflowstatus "Ready for validation", so you don't have to manually publish each event like with the JSON-LD API. Specific trusted partners can get the permission to import events with workflowstatus "Approved", thus bypassing the validation by UiTdatabank admins.

**Only one step necessary to create and publish an offer via CRUD API**
* Create event (`POST /imports/events/`)
