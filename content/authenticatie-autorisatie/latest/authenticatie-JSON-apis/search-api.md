# Authentication for Search API v3

To use Search API v3, you need to authenticate using an API key on every request.

To apply for you personal API key you must register via the [UiTdatabank projectaanvraag platform](https://projectaanvraag.uitdatabank.be).

The API is available in a production and testing environment (See [environments](https://documentatie.uitdatabank.be/content/search_api_3/latest/getting-started/environments.html)), so keys can be obtained for both environments.

Make sure to use the correct API key with the correct environment.

In a seperate book we elaborate the different [methods for authentication](https://documentatie.uitdatabank.be/content/search_api_3/latest/getting-started/authentication.html) for search API V3.
