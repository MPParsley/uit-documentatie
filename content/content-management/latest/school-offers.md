# School offers
School offers are events that are specifically organized and intented for
- ```Students``` (f.e. a school performance)
- ```Teachers``` (f.e. after-school trainings)

School offers are only published on cultuurkuur.be, and *not* on other channels of UiT.

If youâ€™re planning to create school offers through the JSON API, please contact ```content.cultuurkuur@publiq.be``` in advance, so we can assist you in this process.
