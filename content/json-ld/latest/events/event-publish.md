# Publish an event

By default every offer is created with `"workflowstatus":"DRAFT"`

Offers with workflowstatus "DRAFT" are by default excluded from search results

A Publish command is an authenticated request that requires specific permission: it can only be executed by the creator of the offer!

## HTTP request

**!notice the deprecated endpoint `event` instead of `events`!**

```
PATCH /event/{eventId}
```
