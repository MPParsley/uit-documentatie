# timeRange

With the localtime parameters it is possible to filter out events that are happening on a specific part of the day, regardless of the day or date of the event. Typically this parameter is used to filter out events that are happening:
* in the morning
* in the afternoon
* in the evening
* at night

However, these parts of the day are not pre-defined. Using a integer between 0 and 2359 you can define the timeRange yourself.
